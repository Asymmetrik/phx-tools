# FHIR-JSON-SCHEMA-VALIDATOR
> Utility for validating FHIR resources

## Install
```shell
yarn add @asymmetrik/fhir-json-schema-validator
```

## Arguments

`@asymmetrik/fhir-json-schema-validator` exports a single class called JSONSchemaValidator. This class takes one optional
argument for initialization:

>#### `schema`
This is the path to the JSON schema that you would like to validate against. It defaults to the `fhir.schema.json` file
included in this package.

```
let validator = new JSONSchemaValidator(schema)
```

## Usage
The QueryBuilder class has a method called `validate` which takes two arguments:

>#### `resource`
>The resource that is to be validated against the FHIR JSON schema.

>#### `verbose`
>Boolean value specifying whether or not to return the full set of validation errors (true) or to take the time to 
condense error messages (false). Defaults to false.  The error messages generated by the over-arching json schema
 are too numerous to be of any use. For any specific resource, we can compile a resource-specific validator and 
 re-validate to get more concise and helpful error messages.

The `validate` method returns an object with two keys:
>#### `isValid`
>Boolean indicating whether or not the resource is valid or not

>#### `errors`
>List of errors generated from validation. Will be of 0 length when `isValid === true`

See `index.test.js` for examples of usage
